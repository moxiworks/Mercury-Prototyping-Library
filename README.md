# Mercury Prototyping Library

A prototyping library used to demonstrate UX/UI interactions.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`


Please note, this has been built to prototype interactions and animations only. Some of the code is pretty hacky and not meant for production.
